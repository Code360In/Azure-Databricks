binary vectors.\nIt is possible here to improve prediction accuracy by converting each categorical column with an appropriate method.\n\nHere, we will use a combination of [StringIndexer] and [OneHotEncoder] to convert the categorical variables.\nThe `OneHotEncoder` will return a [SparseVector].\n\nSince we will have more than 1 stage of feature transformations, we use a [Pipeline] to tie
